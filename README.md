# Bamazon

## Overview
Bamazon is a full stack web application that was primarily built through javascript. It allows users to add items to a cart and check out. It also has a manager's view where the manager can view the current items being sold, items with low quantities, in stock, restock items, and add new products.

## Technologies Used
Front End
1. HTML/CSS - framework: bootstrap; some custom CSS
2. Javascript: jQuery, bootstrap js cdn

Back End
1. Server: node.js; Packages used: express, faker (for generating dummy data)
2. Database: MySQL db
3. Middleware: Sequelize


## Future Development
The most obvious direction for future development is to have users create profiles where they can "load" money to spend on the application. Because it is a low level imitation of amazon, the features found on amazon.com could be replicated on this webpage at a basic level.
